# Introduction

This is supplementary material for a project in preparation that models occupancy for birds across the Nilgiri and Anamalai hills using citizen science data. 

The main project can be found here: [https://github.com/pratikunterwegs/eBirdOccupancy](https://github.com/pratikunterwegs/eBirdOccupancy).
